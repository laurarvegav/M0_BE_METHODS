# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
    I am proud of knowing where to look for answers when I don't remember technical
    details or terminology, also about my ability to focus for long periods of time 
    finding motivation only in making my ideas to come true.

- What is the power of using methods in our applications?
    If the user inputs requested data and that data is stored in a variable, the methods
    we create allows us to evaluate the variables as needed and return a response according
    to the data that the user gave us, adnd the requirements or standards given by the customer without having to run code per data given, so the project or the final product can run automatically satisfiyng the requirements or standards given by the customer.
